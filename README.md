Music is just a sequence of nodes, yet it helps in calming the mind and soul. We all love humming music and we sometimes create our own beats and wish what if this particular music can be mixed up and something new can be created. 
We present a Music Generation Model using LSTM Deep Learning Model.
The files should be in midi extension for the Music21 to access the data. We need a strong model that can remember the past data, hence using LSTM.
